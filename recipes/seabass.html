        <h1><strong>Sea bass with sizzled ginger, chilli & spring onions</strong></h1>
        <p><h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>2x  sea bass fillets, about 140g/5oz each, skin on and scaled</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>knob of ginger, peeled and shredded into matchsticks</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1.5  fat, fresh red chillies deseeded and thinly shredded</li>
            <li>bunch spring onion, shredded long-ways</li>
            <li>0.5 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        </ol>
            
           

        <h1><strong>Method</strong></h1>
        <p>STEP 1: Season sea bass fillets with salt and pepper, then slash the skin 3 times.</p>
        <p>STEP 2: Heat a heavy-based frying pan and add some oil.</p>
        <p>STEP 3: Once hot, fry the sea bass fillets, skin-side down, for 5 mins or until the skin is very crisp and golden. The fish will be almost cooked through.</p>
        <p>STEP 4: Turn over, cook for another 30 seconds - 1 minute, then transfer to a serving plate and keep warm. Youâ€™ll need to fry the sea bass fillets in 2 batches.</p>
        <p>STEP 5: Heat some oil, then fry the large knob of peeled ginger, cut into matchsticks, 1 thinly sliced garlic clove and 1.5 thinly shredded red chillies for about 2 mins until golden. </p>
        <p>STEP 6: Take off the heat and toss in the bunch of shredded spring onions. Splash the fish with 1 tbsp soy sauce and spoon over the contents of the pan.</p>
